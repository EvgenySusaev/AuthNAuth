# Types of authentication

1. Password-based Authentication:
   Users enter a secret password that is compared to a stored hash of the password.
2. Multi-factor Authentication (MFA):
   Combines two or more authentication factors, such as something you know (password), something you have (smartphone
   with
   an authentication app), and something you are (fingerprint).

3. Biometric Authentication:
   Uses sensors to capture biological characteristics like fingerprints, facial patterns, or iris details, which are
   then
   compared to stored templates.

4. Token-based Authentication:
   Involves a device (physical or software) that generates a unique, time-sensitive code which the user enters along
   with
   their password.

5. Certificate-based Authentication:
   Utilizes digital certificates containing a public key and the identity of the certificate holder issued by a trusted
   Certificate Authority (CA).

6. Smart Card Authentication:
   Users insert a smart card containing an embedded microchip into a card reader, which then communicates with the
   authentication system.
7. Single Sign-On (SSO):
   Users log in once with a single set of credentials to access multiple applications. This is often implemented using
   tokens or federated identity management.

8. OAuth:
   Users grant third-party applications access to their information without sharing passwords, using tokens provided by
   the
   OAuth service.

9. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language):
   Exchanges authentication and authorization data between an identity provider and a service provider using XML-based
   messages.

10. Kerberos Authentication:
    Employs a trusted third-party (Key Distribution Center) to issue tickets that authenticate users and services within
    a
    network.

11. OpenID Connect:
    Adds an identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, allowing clients to verify the identity of the end-user
    based
    on the authentication performed by an authorization server.

12. Behavioral Biometrics:
    Continuously monitors and analyzes user behavior such as typing rhythm, mouse movements, or device usage patterns to
    authenticate users.

13. Risk-based Authentication:
    Assesses the risk of a login attempt by analyzing factors such as location, device, and behavior, and dynamically
    adjusts the authentication requirements accordingly.

14. Hardware Tokens (e.g., YubiKey):
    Users authenticate by connecting a physical device like a YubiKey to their computer or mobile device, which then
    provides a one-time password or cryptographic signature.
