# 1.3 Authentication concepts

Key Aspects of Authentication:
1. Claim of Identity:
You begin by presenting something that claims your identity. This could be entering a username, scanning a fingerprint, or using a card.
2. Proof of Identity:
You then provide proof of your identity, which the system checks against what it knows or has stored. The proof can be something you know (password), something you have (security token), or something you are (biometric data).
3. Verification:
The system compares the proof you provided with the stored information. If they match, the system authenticates you—confirming that you are the legitimate user.


## Authentication Schemes

- Session-based.
- Token-based.
- Single sign-on (SSO)


### Session-Based Authentication

In session-based authentication, the server maintains a session for the user after they log in. 
The session is identified by a session ID, which is stored on the client side, typically in a cookie. 
This session ID is then sent with each subsequent request to verify the user’s identity.

Methods that typically align with session-based authentication:
- Usernames/IDs + Passwords: After login, a session is created, and the session ID is stored in a cookie.
- Smart Cards: When used in conjunction with a system that maintains server-side sessions, a session is created upon successful authentication.
- Biometric Identification: Once authenticated, a session is established and maintained by the server.
- QR Codes/Barcodes: If used in web applications, the server may establish a session after scanning the code.
- NFC: If integrated with a system that uses sessions, authentication would create a server-side session.
- Account Numbers + Passwords: Common in session-based systems like banking applications.
- Customer/Client Numbers + Passwords: Typically used in systems that maintain user sessions.

### Token-Based Authentication

In token-based authentication, the server issues a token (like a JSON Web Token, or JWT) after the user logs in. 
This token is stored on the client side (e.g., in local storage or a cookie) and is sent with each request to authenticate the user. 
The server doesn't maintain a session; instead, it relies on the token for authentication.

Methods that typically align with token-based authentication:

- OAuth Authentication (Social Media Accounts): Often uses JWTs or similar tokens issued by the social media provider.
- Security Tokens (Hardware/Software Tokens): Generate time-based or event-based tokens for authentication.
- Digital Certificates: Can be used in token-based systems, particularly when mutual TLS or other certificate-based systems issue tokens.
- API Key Authentication: The API key functions similarly to a token, where the server uses it to authenticate requests without maintaining sessions.
- Device Fingerprinting: Can be combined with token-based authentication, where a token is issued once the device is verified.
- Email Address (Magic Link): A link generates a token that authenticates the user without needing a session.
- Mobile Number + OTP: Often part of token-based systems where the OTP is exchanged for a token.
- Biometric Authentication (in token-based systems): The biometric data can be used to issue a token instead of maintaining a session.

### Hybrid Approaches

Some systems combine both session-based and token-based authentication:

- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Can be used in either session-based or token-based systems. After MFA verification, a session might be created, or a token might be issued.
- Single Sign-On (SSO): Often uses tokens (like SAML or JWT) to allow authentication across multiple systems, which may then create a session.
- Certificate-Based Authentication: Can be used to issue a token or to establish a session depending on the system design.
