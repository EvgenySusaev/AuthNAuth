# Introduction to authentication and authorization

## Identification

It answers the question, "Who are you?"

Identification is the process by which a user presents himself to the system.

Involves providing a unique identifier such as a username, email address, or user ID.


## Authentication

It answers the question, "Are you really who you claim to be?"

Authentication is the process of verifying:
- something the user knows (password)
- something the user has (phone, token)
- something that is part of the user (biometrics: fingerprint, voice).

Multi-factor requires the user to provide multiple forms of verification to prove their identity.


## Authorization

It answers the question, "What are you allowed to do?"

Authorization is the process of determining what an authenticated user is allowed to do.

Involves checking permissions, roles, or policies to grant or deny access to resources or actions.
