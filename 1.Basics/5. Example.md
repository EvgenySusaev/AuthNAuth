## Security overview

1. You provide your identity card.
2. Security guard verifies your identity and gives to you an internal access card.
3. And then provide you with this internal access card. It contains all info about you that is relevant to facility
4. When you put the card at a validator on a building door, it verifies if you have permission to enter.


Authorization process:
Each page has different requirements. A page checks if you have necessary permissions
Authorization looks your security context and apply requirements to the security context.
Although you logged in you don't have access to the page.





## Identification vs Authentication


The biometric sensor on a device (like a fingerprint scanner or facial recognition system) serves different roles depending on the context:

1. Unlocking the Device (Identification)
   Process: When you use a biometric sensor to unlock your device, the system compares your biometric data (e.g., your fingerprint or face) with the stored biometric template on the device.
   Role: Here, the biometric sensor is used primarily for identificationâ€”it identifies you as the authorized user of the device.
   Outcome: If the biometric data matches, the device is unlocked. The focus here is on confirming your identity to gain access to the device, which is a form of authentication, but it's often referred to as identification in the context of unlocking because the device is recognizing "who" you are.

2. Approving Password Storage or Other Sensitive Operations (Authentication)
   Process: When you use your biometric data to approve a sensitive operation, such as accessing stored passwords, making a payment, or authorizing a secure transaction, the system checks your biometric data as a way of verifying your identity.
   Role: In this context, the biometric sensor is used for authentication. It not only identifies you but also verifies that you are the legitimate user who is authorized to perform a sensitive action.
   Outcome: If the biometric data matches the stored template, the operation is approved. This is a more secure level of interaction, as it often involves a secondary check beyond just identifying the user.
   Key Difference
   Identification (Unlocking): The system uses your biometric data to determine who you are, typically for less critical actions like unlocking the device.
   Authentication (Approving Sensitive Actions): The system uses your biometric data to verify your identity as part of a security process, ensuring that only the authorized user can perform high-security actions like accessing passwords or making payments.
   In summary, while the biometric sensor is used for identification in the context of unlocking the device, it serves as an authentication method when used to approve the use of stored passwords or other sensitive operations. This dual role highlights the flexible nature of biometric sensors in modern devices.
