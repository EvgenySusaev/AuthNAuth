## Authorization Management Systems

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Assigns permissions based on the roles users have within an organization, ensuring they have access only to what’s necessary for their role.
Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC): Uses attributes (e.g., user’s department, location) to determine access permissions dynamically.
Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC): Manages access through detailed policies that specify who can access what resources under which conditions.
