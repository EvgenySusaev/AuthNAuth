## Access Management Systems

Access Control Systems: Enforces policies that determine what authenticated users can do within a system, application, or network.
Privileged Access Management (PAM): Manages and monitors access by users with elevated or privileged permissions to ensure security and compliance.
Federation Services: Enables users to authenticate across different domains or organizations (e.g., using a Google or Facebook account to log in to a third-party application) through standards like SAML or OAuth.
