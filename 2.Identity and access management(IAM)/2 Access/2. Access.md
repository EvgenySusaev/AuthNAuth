## Access Management Systems

This involves defining and enforcing access controls, determining what authenticated users are allowed to do, and managing their access rights to resources. 
Access management is responsible for authorization, which means it decides whether an authenticated identity has permission to access a specific resource or perform a particular action.

Access Control Systems: Enforces policies that determine what authenticated users can do within a system, application, or network.
Privileged Access Management (PAM): Manages and monitors access by users with elevated or privileged permissions to ensure security and compliance.
Federation Services: Enables users to authenticate across different domains or organizations (e.g., using a Google or Facebook account to log in to a third-party application) through standards like SAML or OAuth.




## 1. The User Access (Log-on) Function

This function is concerned with how users access systems or services.

It deals with:
- Authentication: Verifying the identity of a user when they log in. This process often involves checking something the user knows (like a password), something they have (like a smart card or security token), or something they are (like a fingerprint or other biometric data).
- Session Management: After successful authentication, the system manages the user’s session, keeping them logged in securely for a designated period. This involves tracking the user's activity and ensuring that their session is terminated after a period of inactivity or upon logout.
- User Experience Enhancement: Features like Single Sign-On (SSO) fall under this function, providing users with seamless access to multiple systems without needing to authenticate repeatedly. While SSO relies on underlying authentication mechanisms, it focuses on improving the overall user experience by reducing the need for multiple logins.


## 2. The Service Function

The service function in identity management is primarily about delivering personalized, context-aware services to users based on their identity attributes.

This function focuses on the user experience and how identity information can be leveraged to provide tailored access to resources and services:
- Personalization: Services are customized for users based on their identity attributes. This might include displaying specific content, features, or services that are relevant to the user’s role, preferences, or past behavior. For example, a dashboard could be personalized with widgets that show data pertinent to the user’s department or responsibilities.
- Context-Awareness: The service function can adapt based on the context of the user, such as their location, device, time of access, or even their current activity. This allows for dynamic service delivery that aligns with the user's needs and organizational policies.
- Delivery of Services: This involves providing users with access to various applications, content, or resources in a manner that respects their identity attributes and organizational policies. This could include delivering multimedia content, providing access to cloud services, or enabling collaboration tools.


## 3. Identity Federation

This function enables users to authenticate across multiple systems or organizations without needing to manage multiple sets of credentials:
- Federated Identity: In this model, a user's identity is maintained by an Identity Provider (IdP) and can be used across multiple Service Providers (SPs). The IdP is responsible for authenticating the user and issuing security tokens that the SPs can use to grant access.
- Single Sign-On Across Domains: With identity federation, users can log in once with their IdP and gain access to services across multiple domains or organizations. This reduces the need for multiple logins and simplifies access management.
- Standards and Protocols: Federated identity relies on standardized protocols like SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language), OAuth, and OpenID Connect to facilitate secure communication between IdPs and SPs.
