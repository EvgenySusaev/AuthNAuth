Authentication Management:
Login(providing user-password pair) - app verifies and returns a verified identity.
Session authentication - app generates and provides the cookie.
Token authentication - generates and provides the token.

then a request carries the security context, either cookie or token until it expires(then you lose access to entire web app).


## Authentication protocol
These protocols provide authentication and data exchange between systems.

SAML 
OAuth 2.0
OpenID
Liberty Alliance – A consortium promoting federated identity management
Shibboleth (Internet2) – Identity standards targeted towards educational environments
Global Trust Center
Central Authentication Service
NIST SP 800-63

Kerberos - a computer-network authentication protocol
NTLM - NT (New Technology) LAN Manager - is a Microsoft security protocols intended to provide authentication, integrity, and confidentiality to users.


SSO, SAML, OAuth, OpenID Connect:
Purpose: These are protocols or frameworks designed to manage authentication across multiple applications and services, and they also handle authorization in different contexts.
SSO (Single Sign-On): SSO is a user experience feature that allows a user to authenticate once and gain access to multiple systems or applications without logging in separately to each one.
SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language): A protocol used primarily for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, particularly in federated identity scenarios. It allows SSO across different domains.
OAuth: An authorization framework that allows third-party services to exchange information on behalf of a user without exposing their credentials. OAuth is often used for delegating access.
OpenID Connect: A simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol that allows clients to verify the identity of a user based on the authentication performed by an authorization server.





## Authentication Flow

1. Registration
Client:
   Sends registration request with username and password.
Server:
   Hashes the password.
   Saves username and hashed password to the database.
   Creates a security context.
   For Session-Based: Serializes and encrypts the security context into a cookie.
   For Token-Based (JWT): Serializes the security context into a token (JWT).
Server:
   For Session-Based: Sends an HTTP response with the cookie containing the encrypted token.
   For Token-Based (JWT): Sends an HTTP response with the token.
Client:
   For Session-Based: Stores the cookie.
   For Token-Based (JWT): Stores the token (e.g., local storage).

2. Login
Client:
   Sends login request with username and password.
Server:
   Verifies credentials.
   Creates a security context.
   For Cookie-Based: Serializes and encrypts the security context into a cookie.
   For Token-Based (JWT): Serializes the security context into a token (JWT).
Server:
   For Cookie-Based: Sends an HTTP response with the cookie containing the encrypted token.
   For Token-Based (JWT): Sends an HTTP response with the token.
Client:
   For Cookie-Based: Stores the cookie.
   For Token-Based (JWT): Stores the token (e.g., local storage).

3. Resource Request
Client:
   For Cookie-Based:
   Sends HTTP request with the stored cookie.
   For Token-Based (JWT):
   Sends HTTP request with the token in the Authorization header.
Server:
   For Cookie-Based:
   Retrieves and decrypts the cookie.
   Validates the security context.
   Authenticates and authorizes the user.
   For Token-Based (JWT):
   Retrieves and verifies the token.
   Validates the security context.
   Authenticates and authorizes the user.
Server:
   Processes the request and sends the response.

4. OAuth 2.0 Flow (Subset of Token-Based Authentication)
Client:
   Redirects user to the authorization server with client ID and redirect URI.
   Authorization Server:
   Authenticates the user.
   Requests user consent for access.
   Generates an authorization code.
   Authorization Server:
   Redirects user back to the client with the authorization code.
Client:
   Receives the authorization code.
Client:
   Sends the authorization code to the server to exchange for an access token.
Server:
   Validates the authorization code.
   Creates a security context.
   Serializes the security context into an access token (JWT).
   Sends the access token to the client.
Client:
   Stores the access token (e.g., local storage).


## Summary Flow
Registration:

Client sends registration request with username and password.
Server hashes password, saves to database, creates security context.
Server serializes context into cookie (for cookie-based) or token (for token-based/JWT).
Server responds with cookie/token. Client stores it.


Login:

Client sends login request with username and password.
Server verifies credentials, creates security context.
Server serializes context into cookie (for cookie-based) or token (for token-based/JWT).
Server responds with cookie/token. Client stores it.


Resource Request:

Client sends request with cookie (for cookie-based) or token in header (for token-based/JWT).
Server retrieves, decrypts, and validates cookie/token.
Server authenticates and authorizes user.
Server processes request and sends response.


OAuth 2.0:

Client redirects user to authorization server.
Authorization server authenticates user and generates authorization code.
User redirected back to client with authorization code.
Client exchanges authorization code for access token.
Server validates code, creates security context, and sends access token.
Client stores access token.



-------


0. Registration
- During registration, the user's credentials are saved securely in the database with the password hashed.
- A security context is created, serialized, encrypted, and sent back to the client as a cookie in the HTTP response.

```
Client: 
->  Send login http request(user and password)

Server:
    Hashes the provided password.
    Saves the username and hashed password to the database.
    Generates a security context for the authenticated user.
    Serializes and encrypts the security context into a cookie.

<-  Send Sends an HTTP response with the cookie containing the security context.
```


1. Login process(the only authentication)
```
Client: 
->  Sends a login HTTP request with username and password.

Server:
    App checks who u r? 
        Retrieves the user by username from the database.
        Verifies the provided password against the stored hash using a password verification method.
        If the credentials are correct, generates a security context.
        Serializes and encrypts the security context into a cookie.
        Sets the cookie with appropriate options (e.g., HttpOnly, Secure, expiration time).
<-  Sends an HTTP response with the cookie containing the security context.
```


2. Resource request(authentication and authorization)
```
Client: 
->  Send http request

Server:
    App checks who u r?
        1. decrypt cookie 
        2. deserializes cookie into security context
    Check if user is loged in.

    Now user is authenticated.
    App checkRequestedResourceRequirements(securityContext) 

<-  Send proper http response with cookie
```

http context contains security context(cookie)
Authentication happens every request
every http request contains cookie.
Cookie is encrypted
