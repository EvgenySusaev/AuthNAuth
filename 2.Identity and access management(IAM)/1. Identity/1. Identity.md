## Identity provider

An Identity Provider (IdP) is a system or service that creates, manages, and authenticates the digital identities of users.
When a user tries to access a service or application, the Identity Provider is responsible for verifying the user's identity and providing authentication information to the service provider.

How Identity Providers Work
1. Authentication: The Identity Provider handles the initial authentication of the user, typically through methods like passwords, multi-factor authentication, or biometrics.
2. Assertion: After successful authentication, the IdP generates a security token or assertion (e.g., SAML token, OAuth token, or JWT) that contains information about the authenticated user.
3. Access Provision: The service provider (SP) trusts the assertion from the IdP and allows the user to access the requested services or resources without needing to re-authenticate.
4. Single Sign-On (SSO): An IdP can enable Single Sign-On, allowing users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple services or applications without re-entering credentials.

ASP.NET as IdP: Directly handles user registration, authentication, and session management.
Active Directory as IdP: The ASP.NET application relies on an external identity provider to authenticate users and manage identities.


### Identity Provider (IdP) as an ASP.NET Application:

An ASP.NET application can act as an identity provider by managing user accounts, handling authentication, and issuing identity tokens.
This application can include routes (endpoints) for account creation, such as a registration page where users can create accounts using a password-based registration method.
After users authenticate (log in), the application can maintain their session using session-based authentication, typically managed through cookies. This means the user's authenticated state is preserved across multiple requests by storing a session ID or token in the user’s browser.

### Identity Provider (IdP) as Active Directory (Federated Method):
Active Directory (AD) or Azure Active Directory (AAD) can also act as an identity provider in a federated identity scenario.
In this case, the ASP.NET application does not directly manage the user's identity or handle the authentication itself. Instead, it delegates the authentication process to the AD, which verifies the user’s credentials and returns a token or assertion to the ASP.NET application.
This federated approach is useful for single sign-on (SSO) scenarios, where a user can use the same credentials across multiple applications and services.


## Service provider

A Service Provider (SP) is an application, website, or service that relies on an external Identity Provider (IdP) for user authentication.

Interaction:

1. User Requests Access: A user attempts to access a resource on the service provider’s platform (e.g., a web application or service).
2. Redirection to IdP: The service provider redirects the user to the Identity Provider (IdP) for authentication.
3. Authentication at IdP: The user provides their credentials to the IdP. The IdP verifies these credentials and, if successful, authenticates the user.
4. Token or Assertion: After successful authentication, the IdP generates a security token or assertion (like a SAML assertion, OAuth token, or OpenID Connect ID token) that includes information about the user's identity (and possibly attributes like roles or permissions).
5. Token Sent to SP: This token or assertion is sent back to the service provider.
6. Access Decision: The service provider uses the information in the token to verify the user's identity and determine what resources or actions the user is authorized to access or perform.


## Identity Registration(Account creation)

This process is crucial for defining and managing user identities
Account creation is indeed a key component of identity management in the broader security process
Account creation is often the first step in establishing a user's identity in a system, which involves gathering information about the user, such as their username, password, and possibly additional details like email address or phone number.

(During the account creation process, data verification also plays a critical role, especially in contexts where regulatory compliance, security, and trust are paramount. This is often achieved through procedures like Know Your Customer (KYC) and similar verification methods.)


## Identity Maintenance(Management):

Identity management deals with the processes and policies involved in creating, maintaining, and removing digital identities. 
It focuses on managing user attributes, credentials, and the lifecycle of identities within an organization. 
The key components include user registration, credential management, identity lifecycle management (e.g., updates, deletions), and auditing identity-related activities.

The identity maintenance focuses on the core aspects of managing digital identities throughout their lifecycle, independent of access or entitlement decisions. 
It involves the secure and organized handling of identity data from creation to deletion.

- Creation (Identity Registration): This is the process of establishing a new identity in the system. It involves collecting and verifying necessary information about a user, such as their name, email address, and other personal details. During this process, a unique identifier or user ID is typically assigned to the identity. User onboarding happens when a new digital identity is created, setting up the identity within the system.
- Management (Identity Maintenance): This involves updating and maintaining identity information over time to ensure it remains accurate and up-to-date. Key activities include:
  - Profile Management: Allowing users to update their personal information, such as email addresses, phone numbers, or passwords.
  - Credential Management: Handling the creation, updating, and revocation of user credentials, such as passwords, security tokens, and digital certificates.
  - Compliance and Policy Enforcement: Ensuring that identity information complies with organizational policies and regulatory requirements, such as password complexity rules or regular updates.
- Deletion (Identity De-provisioning): This is the process of securely removing an identity from the system. It involves deleting personal information from databases, deactivating associated accounts, and ensuring all traces of the identity are properly removed.
  - Deactivation: Temporarily suspending a user’s identity while retaining the possibility of reactivation.
  - Termination: Permanently removing an identity when a user leaves the organization or no longer requires it, ensuring all data and credentials are revoked.
  - Data Archiving: Depending on compliance requirements, some data associated with the identity might be archived to maintain a record of the user's identity history for future reference or audits.
- Identity Reinstatement: If a user who was deactivated or had their identity deleted needs to return, this process involves re-enabling their identity, potentially with previous or updated details.
- Directory Services: Centralized repositories, like LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) or Active Directory, store and manage identity-related data, providing a structured and secure way to maintain digital identities.



## Federated Identity Management(FIM) 

federated identity - a set of shared principals


Identity Federation refers to a trust relationship established between different domains or organizations, allowing users to use their credentials from one domain (the Identity Provider or IdP) to access services in another domain (the Service Provider or SP). This process enables users to maintain a single identity across various platforms without needing separate accounts for each service.

Purpose: To allow multiple organizations or services to share a user's identity without each one needing to maintain its own user database. This is achieved through federated identity standards like SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language), OAuth, or OpenID Connect.

### Single Sign-On (SSO)

Single Sign-On (SSO) is a user authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications or services with one set of login credentials. SSO enables users to authenticate once with an Identity Provider (IdP) and then gain access to multiple related services without being prompted to log in again for each service.
Purpose: To simplify the user experience by reducing the number of times a user has to log in during a session. It also enhances security by reducing the number of passwords a user needs to remember and manage.

#### How SSO Fits into Identity Federation
SSO is often implemented within the context of Identity Federation:

1. SSO Mechanism in Federated Identity:
In a federated identity scenario, SSO allows users who authenticate with an Identity Provider (IdP) to access multiple Service Providers (SPs) without needing to log in separately to each SP.
The IdP authenticates the user once and then passes a token or assertion (like a SAML assertion or OAuth token) to the SPs, which trust the IdP to have properly authenticated the user.
2. Federated Identity Standards:
Standards like SAML, OAuth, and OpenID Connect enable both Identity Federation and SSO by defining how authentication and authorization data is securely exchanged between IdPs and SPs. These standards allow a seamless SSO experience across federated systems.
3. Use Case:
For example, an employee logs in to their company's central authentication service (the IdP). Once authenticated, they can access various internal tools like email, HR portals, and collaboration software without needing to log in again for each application, thanks to SSO enabled by the federated identity framework.

Conclusion
While SSO and Identity Federation are different concepts, SSO is a critical component of federated identity systems. Identity Federation enables the sharing of identity information across domains, and SSO leverages this capability to provide a seamless authentication experience across multiple services.
