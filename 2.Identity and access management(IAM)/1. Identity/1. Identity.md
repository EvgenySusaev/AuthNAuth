# Identity Management:

Identity management can involve five basic functions:

1. The pure identity function(without regard to access or entitlements):
   - creation
   - management 
   - deletion
2. The user access (log-on) function: For example: a smart card and its associated data used by a customer to log on to a service or services (a traditional view);
3. The service function: A system that delivers personalized, role-based, online, on-demand, multimedia (content), presence-based services to users and their devices.
4. Identity Federation: A system that relies on federated identity to authenticate a user without knowing their password. One system acts as the Identity Provider (IdP) and other system(s) acts as Service Provider (SP)
5. Audit function: Monitor bottlenecks, malfunctions and suspect behavior.

Identity Management (IdM) is the overarching framework that deals with the creation, maintenance, and use of digital identities. It includes processes and tools for managing user identities and controlling access to resources.

Key Components: 
- User registration:
- Identity provisioning
- Identity lifecycle management
- De-provisioning.


## Identity Lifecycle Management

Identity Lifecycle Management is a comprehensive process that includes several key stages, each responsible for managing different aspects of a user's identity from creation to deletion. 

# Creation and Management of User Identities:

This involves creating, modifying, and deleting user identities in a secure and organized manner.
It includes managing attributes like usernames, passwords, roles, and other personal information.



Identity Lifecycle Management typically includes:

1. Identity Creation (Registration)
   User Onboarding: Creating a new digital identity when a user joins an organization or registers for a service. This involves collecting necessary information, such as username, email, and password, and possibly assigning roles and permissions.
   Provisioning: Setting up the new user account with access to necessary systems, applications, and resources based on their role.
2. Identity Maintenance (Management and Modification)
   Profile Management: Allowing users to update their personal information, such as email addresses, phone numbers, or passwords.
   Role and Permission Changes: Modifying a user’s roles and permissions as they move to different positions within the organization or as their needs change.
   Credential Management: Managing the creation, update, and revocation of user credentials, such as passwords, security tokens, and digital certificates.
   Compliance and Policy Enforcement: Ensuring that the identity complies with organizational policies and regulatory requirements, such as password complexity or regular updates.
3. Access Management
   Access Reviews and Certification: Periodically reviewing and certifying that users have the appropriate access rights to systems and data, and making necessary adjustments.
   Access Requests: Handling user requests for additional access to resources and managing the approval workflow.
   Audit Logging and Monitoring: Tracking and logging access to ensure that user activities are in compliance with policies and to detect any unauthorized access.
4. Identity De-provisioning (Deactivation and Deletion)
   Deactivation: Temporarily suspending a user’s access, often used in cases of extended leave or security concerns, where the identity might be reinstated later.
   Termination: Fully removing access when a user leaves the organization or no longer requires the identity, ensuring that all permissions and credentials are revoked.
   Data Archiving: Depending on compliance requirements, some data associated with the identity might be archived rather than deleted, to maintain a record of the user's access history.
5. Identity Reinstatement
   Re-enabling: If a user who was deactivated or had their account deleted needs to return, this process involves re-enabling their identity with previous or updated roles and permissions.


Directory Services: Centralized repositories (like LDAP, Active Directory) store and manage identity-related data.
