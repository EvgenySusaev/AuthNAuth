Cookies are typically generated and set by a web server in response to a client's request, and this process can be divided into several steps:

1. Client Request:
   A user initiates a request to a server (e.g., by logging in, visiting a website, or performing some action that requires authentication).
2. Server Processing:
   The server processes the request. If authentication or session management is required, the server may generate a new cookie. For example:
   Session Cookies: When a user logs in, the server may generate a session cookie to maintain the user's session.
   Authentication Cookies: The server might generate a cookie that contains authentication information, such as a session token, encrypted user credentials, or a JWT (JSON Web Token).
3. Cookie Creation:
   The server creates the cookie with specific attributes:
   Name: The name of the cookie.
   Value: The content of the cookie, which could include session IDs, tokens, or other data.
   Domain and Path: Specifies which domains or paths the cookie should be sent to.
   Expiration: Determines how long the cookie should persist (session cookies typically expire when the browser is closed, while persistent cookies have a specific expiration time).
   Secure and HttpOnly Flags: Secure ensures the cookie is sent over HTTPS only, and HttpOnly prevents client-side scripts from accessing the cookie.
4. Setting the Cookie:
   The server includes the cookie in the HTTP response header Set-Cookie.
   Example HTTP header:
   ```
   Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; Path=/; HttpOnly; Secure; Expires=Wed, 09 Aug 2024 10:00:00 GMT
   ```
5. Client Storage:
   The user's browser (or client) receives the cookie and stores it according to the cookie's properties.
   For subsequent requests, the browser automatically includes the cookie in the Cookie header if the request matches the domain and path of the cookie.
6. Subsequent Requests:
   When the client makes subsequent requests to the server, it includes the cookie in the Cookie header, which allows the server to recognize the user and manage the session or authentication state.
   Example Flow:
   User logs in → Server authenticates → Server sets a session cookie (Set-Cookie: sessionId=xyz; HttpOnly; Secure) → Browser stores the cookie → User makes another request → Browser sends Cookie: sessionId=xyz → Server recognizes the user.
   The specific implementation details, such as how the cookie is encrypted and what data it contains, depend on the security and design considerations of the application you're working on.
