# Introduction to authentication and authorization

## Key Concepts


### Identification

It answers the question, "Who are you?"
Identification is the process of claiming an identity.
Typically, involves providing a unique identifier such as a username, email address, or user ID.


### Authentication

It answers the question, "Are you really who you claim to be?"
Authentication is the process of verifying the claimed identity.
Involves verifying the identifier (e.g., username) along with a secret or credential (e.g., password, biometric data, token).


### Authorization

It answers the question, "What are you allowed to do?"
Authorization is the process of determining what an authenticated user is allowed to do.
Involves checking permissions, roles, or policies to grant or deny access to resources or actions.

## Security overview

1. You provide your identity card.
2. Security guard verifies your identity and gives to you an internal access card - generate security context.
3. And then provide you with this internal access card. It contains all info about you that is relevant to facility
4. When you put the cart to validator on a door of a building, it verifies security context satisfies the access requirements.

Authentication process:
Login(providing user-password pair) - app provides SecurityContext.
Cookie authentication - app generates and provides the cookie.
Token auth - generates and provides the token.

then a request carries the security context, either cookie or token until it expires(then you lose access to entire web app).

Authorization process:
Each page has different requirements. A page checks if you have necessary permissions
Authorization looks your security context and apply requirements to the security context.
Although you logged in you don't have access to the page.
