# 1.2 Authentication concepts

## Authentication Schemes

- Cookie-based Authentication: Uses cookies to maintain authentication state across requests.
- Token-based Authentication: Uses tokens (e.g., JWT) to maintain authentication state, typically used in APIs.
- OAuth and OpenID Connect: Protocols for token-based authentication, allowing integration with third-party identity providers.
- ASP.NET Core Identity: A membership system that adds login functionality to applications.


## Claims and Roles:

- Claims: Key-value pairs associated with a user, representing user data.
- Roles: Groups that users belong to, often used for authorization.
