1. Login process(the only authentication)
```
Client: 
->  Send login http request(user and password)

Server:
    App checks who u r? 
        1. verifies credentials
    Generates Security context 
    Serialize context to cookie
<-  Send http response with cookie
```


2. Resource request(authentication and authorization)
```
Client: 
->  Send http request

Server:
    App checks who u r?
        1. decrypt cookie 
        2. deserializes cookie into security context
    Check if user is loged in.

    Now user is authenticated.
    App checkRequestedResourceRequirements(securityContext) 

<-  Send proper http response with cookie
```

http context contains security context(cookie)
Authentication happens every request
every http request contains cookie. 
Cookie is encrypted
